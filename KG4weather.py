"Your [SNOW STATISTICS] for the day are: 100% chance of snow... at least 100 inches! Be prepared to get snowed in by noon!\"\n\n\"...this isn't good... I'm not ready for hibearnation...",

"Whew, is it getting hot in here, or is it just the weather? Wait, wait, that's the wrong saying...",

"Blue skies and hot, hot sun as far as the eye can see... that's your weather report, from yours truly.",

"The weather is... well... I'm burning right up! It's heating up my body... it's... it's... just way too hot...",

"So it's a beautiful, sunny day, and I won't have you all wasting it. Your homework assignment for the day: get at least 10 hours of sun. Get on it!",

"It's a great day to kick back and relax with a drink by the beach... which is what I'm going to be doing.",

"It's a hot and heavy day, to get some hot and heavy schoolwork done... are you excited, students? I'm panting! Because it's really hot outside.",

"Ohhhh, oh, oh, it's so hot, I'm panting, I'm sweating, I'm melting, I'm gonna be a bearsicle... once you put me in the freezer.",

"It's a beautiful sunny day, just the perfect sort of day to get a tan. Except, that causes sun cancer now... EVERYTHING kills you, huh?",

"What a hot hot hot day! I'm gonna put on my bikini and lounge by the pool all day... any of you kids care to join me? [‚ù§Ô∏è]",

"It's another beautiful day for another beautiful class... *sniff*. I'll be SO sad once you're all gone.",

"It looks like sunny skies and clear weather, today, folks... a perfect day for flying... strap on your seatbelts and get ready for take-off.",

"Cloudy. Cloudy with a chance of meatballs. That's a reference, did you get it?",

"Good day for cloud watching. Well, the sky's kinda one huge cloud today...",

"The weather is nice and cool today... a good day for outdoor activities! That's your Monokuma weather report!",

"Cool sky, cool weather... not much sun, but, otherwise, a wonderful day. Why not spend it outside?",

"Like a sunny day, only with more cloud.",

"You know, have you ever looked at a cloud and really thought it looked like something? I just saw this one, and I thought it looked just like you. I wanted to tell you that.",

"Rain, rain, go away, come again another day... or how about never?",

"You think it wouldn't matter, but rain always makes me gloomy... maybe I should do something to spice up the day!",

"Wet and rainy... it's a perfect day to share an umbrella with that special someone. [‚ù§Ô∏è]",

"Here's a suggestion, class: always bring an umbrella with you. Then you'll always have one. Isn't that a good idea?",

"Rain is kind of like tears, only not as salty. Tears are better. Salt is an essential nutrient, yanno.",

"It's raining today... where do you think all this water comes from? You'd think the sky would run out of water eventually. JUST KIDDING. I know how rain works, idiots. [üí¢]",

"It's going to be raining ALL DAY. How can a sky hold so much water? It's not right.",

"Cool, cold, wet... it's a rainy day, folks. Probably best for you to stay inskde today.",

"You know, water isn't free, but rain water is. And free is good. I'm going to bottle it and sell it and get rich.",

"It's RAINING. Some people might like rain, but not us bears. It makes our fur all wet and damp... *sigh*...",

"The storm rages and pounds like my heart when I think of you, class. When I think of you killing each other... [‚ù§Ô∏è]",

"Don't stormy days FILL YOU WITH ENERGY? [üí¢] W-what? No?",

"I like stormy days a lot better than rainy ones. There's a lot more noise, for one.",

"100% CHANCE OF HEAVY RAIN. Best to stay indoors if there's any helping it!",

"Heavy rain, ALL DAY. Best stay inside, kiddos. I wouldn't recommend going out, not even with an umbrella!",

"Kids, I'm the world's biggest proponent for umbrellas, but even they're not good enough for today... best stay in!",

"BOOOM! You hear that thunder!? It's storming HARD. Best stay inside today, kiddos!",

"It's a cold day today, class, so don't forget to bundle up and stay warm! Otherwise you could catch a cold...",

"It's so cold today. I just want to stay in bed all day...",

"What about snow makes humans go out and roll in it? It's like DOGS, except even dogs don't roll around in snow. More brains than humans! [üí¢]",

"What's the big deal about snow, anyway? It's cold and wet and slippery. BIG DEAL.",

"Look out the window, kids. Yep! It's snowing. How's that for a wonder?",

"It's a day to curl up with a mug of hot cocoa and a good book. I suggest you all go do that.",

"Hello, folks. I'd like to retract a statement I made the other day. I was wrong. It was the wrong weather, and I am sorry.",
